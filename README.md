# Mikel Eguiluz tech test

## Basic build

At Attrax we have decided to branch out into the world of tourism and as such we would like you to
build us a homepage based on the design we have attached (see XD link below).
As we expect most users to view the site via their mobile, we would like the build approach to reflect
this.
We would like a modal to open when you click on the read more button of the ‘Fancy getting out of
London’ banner. The modal can be simple containing lorem ipsum text and a close button, this is more
for demonstration purposes at this stage.
On mobile we would like the navigation to open and close by it sliding out from the left when you click
the burger bar in the top corner, again this can be simple and we will leave the styling options up to you.

## Bonus elements

We aren’t very sure about interactions other than the basic button color change on hover which you can
see in the style guide. Feel free to add any interactions, transitions etc... you feel may help improve the
homepage look and feel.
We are big on performance here, we don’t want to keep potential sightseers waiting around, so any
performance optimization you can do would be great.
Any knowledge you have about accessibility that you feel could be incorporated into the build would be
great to see too.

## Further information

We would like you to complete this without the use of a framework such as bootstrap or React, but feel
free to use jQuery if you like.
All image assets are included in the XD link and can be downloaded, and we have provided you with the
font files.
When it comes to development environment you can use whatever code editor you like, and we will
leave the folder/file structure down to you.
Please provide a link to download your solution once finished. We will be reviewing your project and
critiquing it, but we would like you to take us through your thought process and anything you found
challenging in the next interview.
